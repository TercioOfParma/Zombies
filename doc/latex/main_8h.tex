\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
struct \hyperlink{structentity}{entity}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em entity\+: Used to represent a generic character in the game, can be pretty much anything although at the moment only pits, zombies and the player \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
struct \hyperlink{structvector_data}{vector\+Data}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Vector\+Data\+: Used for Holding the position vector of an entity, may be used later for other vectors such as velocity. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
